## Bugs Detected:
  * When testing the function  "update_stock(choice, product_list)" and function "update worksheet()",
    there was a problem with the correct data being retrieved from the "Tuple" that the first function returned.
    The worksheet was not updated and a message about incorrect data appeared.
  * The problem was solved by changing the 'Tuple' to a 'List' and converting the numeric input to integer.
  
## Unfixed Bugs:
  * All detected bugs have been fixed.
